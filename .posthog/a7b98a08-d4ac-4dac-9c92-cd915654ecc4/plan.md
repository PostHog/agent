# Implementation Plan: Update README.md with TEST123

**Task ID:** a7b98a08-d4ac-4dac-9c92-cd915654ecc4  
**Generated:** 2025-10-29

## Summary

Append the text "TEST123" to the end of the existing README.md file located at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`. This is a straightforward text addition requiring a single Edit tool operation to add the test string after the current last line (line 259).

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analysis
- [x] Located README.md at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- [x] Confirmed file contains 259 lines of documentation about PostHog Agent SDK
- [x] Identified last line ends with permission system note
- [x] No special formatting or structural constraints at file end

### 2. Changes Required
- [x] Single file modification: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- [x] No dependencies to add or update
- [x] No related files require changes

### 3. Implementation
- [ ] Use Edit tool to append "TEST123" to the end of README.md
- [ ] Add newline before "TEST123" for proper formatting
- [ ] Verify change applied successfully by reading the file

## File Changes

### New Files
```
None
```

### Modified Files
```
/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md - Append "TEST123" to end of file
```

**Specific Change:**
- Locate the final line: "**Note**: Research and planning phases have fixed, read-only tool sets. The `canUseTool` hook only applies to the build phase and direct run calls."
- Append a newline followed by "TEST123" after this line

## Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- Use Edit tool with old_string matching the end of the current file content
- Include sufficient context (last few lines) to ensure unique match
- Add appropriate whitespace (newline) before "TEST123" for clean formatting

### Potential Risks
- **Low risk**: Simple text append operation with no dependencies
- **Minimal impact**: No code functionality affected, documentation-only change
- **Reversible**: Easy to revert if needed

### Testing Approach
- Read the modified README.md file to confirm "TEST123" appears at the end
- Verify file integrity (no unintended changes to existing content)
- Confirm proper formatting with newline separation

### Edge Cases
- None identified - straightforward append operation
