I'll analyze the codebase to understand the structure and locate the README.md file.
Let me find the root-level README.md file:
Perfect! I've located the README.md file at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`. Now I have all the information needed to provide a research plan.

```markdown
# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
The repository is a TypeScript Agent SDK for PostHog's Array desktop app. The root README.md file is located at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` and currently contains 259 lines of documentation about the PostHog Agent SDK, covering features, usage, configuration, and permissions.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- **Location**: End of the file (after line 259)
- **Task**: Append "TEST123" to the end of the README.md file

## Implementation Context
- The README.md file is a standard documentation file with proper markdown formatting
- Current file size: 7617 bytes
- File ends at line 259 with a note about read-only and modification tools
- No special formatting constraints identified at the end of the file

## Plan
1. Read the current README.md file to confirm its end state
2. Append "TEST123" to the end of the file using the Edit tool
3. Verify the change was applied successfully
```
I've completed the analysis phase. Here's my research findings:

# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
The repository is a TypeScript Agent SDK for PostHog's Array desktop app. The root README.md file is located at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` and currently contains 259 lines of documentation covering the PostHog Agent SDK features, usage, configuration, and permissions. The file ends with a note about available tool names in the permission system.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- **Current size**: 7617 bytes (259 lines)
- **Modification scope**: Append "TEST123" to the end of the file

## Implementation Context
- The README.md file is a standard markdown documentation file with no special formatting constraints at the end
- The final line (259) ends with "**Note**: Research and planning phases have fixed, read-only tool sets. The `canUseTool` hook only applies to the build phase and direct run calls."
- No dependencies or related files need modification

## Plan
1. Append "TEST123" to the end of `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` using the Edit tool
2. Verify the change was successfully applied

Ready to proceed when you confirm!
