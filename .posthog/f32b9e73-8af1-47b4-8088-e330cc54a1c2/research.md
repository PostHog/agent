I've reviewed the task and the README.md file. This is a very straightforward task - adding the text "TEST" to the bottom of the README.md file. 

Given the simplicity of this task, there are minimal implementation decisions that would meaningfully impact the outcome. However, I'll identify the few clarifying questions that exist:
I see - I need to follow the research mode instructions and use a `create_plan` tool instead. However, I notice that the `create_plan` tool is not available in my tool list. Let me use the ExitPlanMode tool as specified in the system instructions, but format my output according to the research mode requirements:

Based on my analysis of the README.md file and the task requirements, here are the clarifying questions:

# Research Questions

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the key questions to guide implementation:

## Question 1: Where exactly should "TEST" be added in the README.md?

**Options:**
- a) At the very end of the file, after the "Precedence for query options" line, as a standalone line
- b) As a new section at the end (e.g., "## TEST") to maintain the document's section structure
- c) Something else (please specify)

## Question 2: Should "TEST" include any formatting or remain as plain text?

**Options:**
- a) Plain text "TEST" on a new line with no additional formatting
- b) Formatted as a code block, heading, or with markdown emphasis (bold/italic)
- c) Something else (please specify)

## Question 3: Should there be any spacing or additional context around "TEST"?

**Options:**
- a) Add one blank line before "TEST" for visual separation from the existing content
- b) No blank lines - append directly after the last line of content
- c) Something else (please specify)

Since this is an extremely straightforward task with minimal architectural decisions, I'm ready to proceed with the most literal interpretation unless you have specific preferences for any of these questions.
