Perfect! I've completed the research phase and presented the plan. The task is to add a funny joke to the README.md file. 

Based on my analysis:

- The joke should be added naturally while maintaining the professional tone of developer documentation
- No clarifying questions are needed—the task is clear and straightforward

The plan is ready for your confirmation. Once you approve, I'll proceed with adding an appropriate and well-placed joke to the README.
