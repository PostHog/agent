I'll analyze the repository structure to understand the current state of the README.md file and prepare for this task.
Now let me read the actual README.md file:
Perfect! I have all the information I need. The README.md file exists and contains 259 lines of documentation about the PostHog Agent SDK. The task is straightforward: add "HI!" to the end of the file.

```markdown
# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
The README.md file is located at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` and currently contains 259 lines of documentation describing the PostHog Agent SDK, including quick start instructions, key features, usage examples, configuration options, and permission system documentation.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- **Modification location**: End of the file (after line 259)
- **Change**: Add "HI!" as a new line

## Implementation Context
The README.md file currently ends at line 259 with the text "**Note**: Research and planning phases have fixed, read-only tool sets. The `canUseTool` hook only applies to the build phase and direct run calls."

The task requires appending "HI!" to the end of this file.

## Clarifying Questions
None required. The task is explicit and unambiguous.
```
The plan has been presented above. I'm ready to proceed once you confirm. The task is straightforward:

1. **Read the current README.md** (already done - 259 lines)
2. **Append "HI!" to the end** using the Edit tool
3. **Verify the change** was made successfully

Please confirm when you'd like me to proceed with the implementation.
