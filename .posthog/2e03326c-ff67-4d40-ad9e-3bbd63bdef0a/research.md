I'll analyze the codebase to understand the context and generate clarifying questions for adding "HELP" to the CHANGELOG.md.
Let me look at the project root structure and the current CHANGELOG.md more carefully:
Let me check the README and CLAUDE.md files to better understand the project:
Based on my research of the codebase, I can see that:

1. **The CHANGELOG.md** follows a semantic versioning structure with sections for Major/Minor/Patch changes
2. **Current version** is 1.4.0 (shown in CHANGELOG.md) but package.json shows 1.14.0
3. **The task is to add "HELP" to CHANGELOG.md** - but the request is unclear about what exactly should be added or where

The task description is minimal and lacks specifics. Here are the critical decisions needed:

# Research Questions

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the key questions to guide implementation:

## Question 1: What type of change is "HELP"?

**Options:**
- a) A new feature/Minor Change that should be added to a new version section (e.g., 1.5.0)
- b) A bugfix/Patch Change that should be added to the existing 1.4.0 section
- c) Something else (please specify)

## Question 2: Where in the CHANGELOG should "HELP" be added?

**Options:**
- a) As a new top-level version section (for an unreleased version)
- b) To the existing 1.4.0 Minor Changes section
- c) Something else (please specify)

## Question 3: What is the complete text/description for the "HELP" entry?

**Options:**
- a) Just the word "HELP" alone as a bullet point
- b) "Add HELP command/functionality" or similar descriptive text
- c) Something else (please specify)
