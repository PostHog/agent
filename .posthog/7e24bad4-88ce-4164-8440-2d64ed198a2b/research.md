I'll analyze the repository structure and understand the current state of the README.md file.
Now let me read the current README.md file to understand its contents:
Perfect! I have all the information I need. The task is straightforward: add "HELLO" to the end of README.md. Let me present my plan.
# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
The repository is a PostHog Agent SDK written in TypeScript that provides an agent framework for task execution. The README.md file at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` currently contains 148 lines covering:
- Project overview and quick start instructions
- Key features and usage examples
- Task execution workflow (3-phase approach)
- File system structure
- Progress tracking mechanisms
- Requirements and configuration options

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- **Current length**: 148 lines
- **Modification location**: End of file (after line 148)

## Implementation Context
The README follows standard documentation patterns with clear sections using markdown headers, code blocks, and inline formatting. The file ends with a configuration options example showing TypeScript code. Adding "HELLO" will simply append this text at the very end of the file.

## Plan
I will:
1. Use the Edit tool to append "HELLO" to the end of README.md
2. Verify the change was applied successfully

This is a straightforward text append operation with no architectural decisions or dependencies required.
