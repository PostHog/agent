I'll analyze the repository to understand its structure and locate the readme.md file.
Now let me read the main README.md file:
Perfect! I have all the context I need. The README.md file is straightforward and well-documented. Now let me present the plan for adding a joke to it.

# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
The repository is the **PostHog Agent SDK** — a TypeScript agent framework that wraps the Claude Agent SDK. The README.md file at `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` is the main documentation file containing:
- Project description and quick start guide
- Key features overview
- Usage examples with code snippets
- Task execution flow explanation
- File system structure documentation
- Progress update examples
- Requirements and configuration options

The README is well-structured with clear sections, code blocks, and documentation that explains the agent framework's functionality.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md`
- **Location options**: Could be added to:
  - Beginning (after title as an intro)
  - End of file (after Configuration Options section)
  - Within an existing section as a comment

## Implementation Context
- The README is purely documentation/markdown
- No code dependencies or build requirements
- File uses standard markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and lists
- The content is technical in nature (SDK documentation)

## Clarifying Questions

## Question 1: Where should the joke be placed in the README?
**Options:**
- a) At the very end of the file (after Configuration Options section)
- b) Near the beginning as a fun intro line right after the main title
- c) Something else (please specify)
```
I've completed my research analysis. Here's what I found:

**README.md Overview**: The file is a well-structured technical documentation for the PostHog Agent SDK, containing sections on Quick Start, Key Features, Usage, Task Execution, File System, Progress Updates, Requirements, and Configuration Options.

**Key Findings**:
- Single file to modify: `/Users/jonathan/dev/agent/README.md` (148 lines)
- Professional technical documentation style
- Follows standard markdown conventions

**Clarifying Question**: Where would you like the joke placed?
- **Option a)** At the very end of the file (after Configuration Options section)
- **Option b)** Near the beginning as a fun intro line right after the main title
- **Option c)** Somewhere else (please specify)

Once you confirm the placement preference, I can add an appropriate joke that fits the SDK/agent development context.
